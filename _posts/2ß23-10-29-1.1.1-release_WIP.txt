Guess what, it's update time again! Time GOES by so fast - it's been a month now since V1.1.0 was released (See what we did there?).
So we figured a small maintenance update will do no harm, to get you amazing folks some more features!

# New features

## Better projections
Aang23 made some overtime and implemented a new projection algorithm to finally replace the old and crusty pre-1.0.0 algorithm.
He made a fantastic writeup [[here](https://www.satdump.org/posts/projection-story/)] that is definitely worth checking out. Don't worry, the old
Algo is still there. It...just has a better friend now. You can also select colors for different parts of the map overlay now.

[Add projection image here, maybe the one from the writeup]

## Better TLE loading
Instead of pulling every needed TLE separately, SatDump is now getting its TLEs from Celestrak's Active.txt list. TLE loading was improved, making SatDump launch faster and more stable (Thanks JVital2013!).

## AMSU calibration
Thanks to Zbychu's endurance when it come to reading the NOAA KLM Guide, we finally have AMSU-A2 calibrated. This means its now producing calibrated data that actually can be used to do science. Its available for NOAA-15/18/19 and METOP-B/C.

## RTL-TCP improvements
RTL-TCP now supports PPM correction.

## Pipelines
Pipelines for Psyche, PVCC and ODIN were added. There is no decoder yet, since we didn't manage to collect enough data for decoder construction yet. 

##Tons of retuning
Projections for METEOR, NOAA, METOP and FY were improved and should be more accurate. Some satellites seem to wobble a bit, so its not impossible for some projections to be slightly off again.


# List of killed bugs

## MacOS File problems
The "Save as" dialog on MacOS did not work properly, fixed now.

## Windows cleanup
A bug caused the recorder/FFT split to be uneven. Fixed by JVital2013.

## FY3 fixes
Some small problems with FY-3 arose, like a inconsistent handling of the LDPC. Everything is retuned and stable now.

## Composite fixup
Lego11 cleaned up the Composite presets available in the SatDump viewer.

## Android fixes
Small stuff on Android, like a keyboard showing up in situations where a keyboard is not needed, was repaired.

## UDP Source on Windows
Argh, windows struck once again. The UDP source didn't work properly here, because Windows likes beeing special. Fixed.
