Yet another update has been beamed to your computers now!
This time starring:

# New features

## Automation improvements

It is now possible to very easily build an automated station for APT or LRPT satellites, advantageously replacing previous setups that required anywhere from 5 to 12 separate pieces of software.

lego11 has made [a detailed configuration guide](https://www.a-centauri.com/articoli/automating-satellite-reception-with-satdump) for such a station.

Later, additional features such as simultaneous reception of NOAA APT and DSB, or LRPT and APT, are planned.


## A lot of image enhancements

We added **a lot of** enhancements for AVHRR this time.

APT and HRPT had **all** the «traditional» NOAA enhancements added by lego11. Included are: BD (Hurricane), MD, MB, CC, EC, HE, HF, JF, JJ, ZA, TA. This means that SatDump has now complete feature parity with WXtoImg with respect to the meteorologic capabilities.

Additionally, Marhmarchi has made an experimental night time fire detection enhancement based on the brightness temperature of AVHRR channels 3b and 4. It appears to work quite well, but more data is necessary.

## Alpha channels in composites

It is possible to have an alpha channel in the composite's equations, making it possible to build transparent composites that are designed to be overlaid on top of other channels.

A typical use case would be overlaying MHS data over AVHRR, for example. 

A `Rainfall (transparent)` composite that makes use of the alpha channel is already included in SatDump if you want to try it out.

Projections are also supported with this new system.

## New APT projections

Aang23 remade the APT projections, which are now much better than with the previously used algorithm.

## JPSS-1 DNB projections

JPSS-1's DNB channel can now be projected correctly.

## ATMS calibration

ATMS is now calibrated on all JPSS satellites (including little SUOMI NPP) and can be used for science work, providing higher resolution and more channels than our other calibrated microwave imager, MHS.

## Arbitrarily long APT passes support

SatDump now supports arbitrarily long APT passes, which could happen if you forgot to stop the recording before switching to another satellite. Previously, the limit was 15 minutes.

The decoded image preview has been updated to also support this, so the image will not be cut off!

## GUI backend improvements

JVital2013 has made several improvements to the GUI system, improving compatibility with older graphic cards and Android systems and reducing the chance of the dreaded gray or corrupted screens appearing.

## QTH location marker

When the QTH location is set in SatDump's options, it can be shown in the map. The color can be chosen too.

## Proba V-CC pipeline update

The Proba V-CC's pipeline has been updated. The satellite is still in the commisioning phase, so further updates are expected.

## Manual bandwidth choice on LimeSDR

LimeSDR users can now choose a custom, manually specified bandwidth for their SDR.

# List of poor bugs we killed (yet again)

## HackRF crash

If the HackRF was in use by another program, SatDump could crash. This was fixed.

## Toast notification crash

Too many toast notifications could cause a crash in certain circumstances. That has been fixed too.

## Bug with Aqua

A bug has been fixed with the Aqua satellite decoder.

## Ephemeris fixes on JPSS

Corrupted ephemeris data could lead to unexpected results on JPSS projections. This is no longer the case.

## LRPT and GOES fixes

JVital2013 did a bunch of LRPT and GOES fixes!

## The last minute fix...
